    One of my hobbies is listening to music. My favorite group is called Stray
    Kids. They are a K-POP group and make amazing music. But I also listen to
    other groups like (G)I-DLE, NewJeans, Twice, Aespa, LE SSERAFIM, Itzy, Kiss
    Of Life, XG, NMIXX, Enhypen, P1harmony, IU, Chuu and Wave To Earth. During
    the summer holidays, I was at a Stray Kids concert and it changed my life. I
    don't just listen to K-POP tho. I also like pop. For example, I was also at
    the Taylor Swift concert in ZÃ¼rich this year.

    My second and last hobby is playing video games with my best friend. We like
    to play fighting and horror games the most. fun fact: I always have to go
    first. I met my best friend online about 5 years ago and we've been playing
    ever since. We also got to meet each other this summer, as he comes from
    Germany. My hobby in general is just talking to my best friend. We're often
    just in a call until 3 in the morning. I'm really glad that I got to meet
    such a wonderful person. And I'm really grateful to be his best friend.
